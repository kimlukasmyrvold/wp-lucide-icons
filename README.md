# WP Icons

A WordPress plugin for placing icons from eight open-source icon libraries, including [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/), [Material Symbols](https://fonts.google.com/icons) (Outlined), [Phosphor](https://phosphoricons.com/), [Tabler Icons](https://tabler.io/icons), and [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/). Icons render as inline SVG. See [Icon libraries](#icon-libraries) for the full list, versions, and licenses.

The plugin is **WP Icons**. The repository and plugin folder are `wp-lucide-icons`.

- Requires WordPress 6.6+ and PHP 8.1+
- License: [GPLv2 or later](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html)
- Site: [GitHub](https://github.com/kimlukasmyrvold/wp-lucide-icons)
- Issues: [GitHub](https://github.com/kimlukasmyrvold/wp-lucide-icons/issues)

## Features

- **Icon** block in the block editor
- **Insert icon** on paragraph, heading, and other RichText toolbars
- **Insert icon** button in the classic editor (TinyMCE) and in Elementor visual text fields
- **WP Icons** widget in Elementor, and a **WP Icons** element in Flatsome UX Builder
- `[wp_icon]` shortcode
- Admin **Library** browser and **Settings**
- Bundled SVG catalogs, with an optional cached CDN refresh when the bundle is stale

In Flatsome UX Builder iframes, the plugin loads a small script so inline icons preview correctly.

## Icon libraries

All eight libraries ship with the plugin. Each catalog is generated from a pinned npm package version (below); the optional CDN source can download a newer version later. Catalogs load per library, only when a library is opened in the picker or used on a page.

| Library                                                       | Status  | Library id         | npm package                 | Version | License                                                                                                                                                                    |

Some icons are left out on purpose. Simple Icons whose own license is non-commercial, no-derivatives, AGPL, GPL-only, or custom are excluded, and so are the GitHub and Copilot logos in Octicons. The rules are in `config/icon-exclusions.json` (see `config/README.md`), and the license texts ship in `licenses/` and on **Appearance → WP Icons → Settings → View licenses**.

Each icon set is a third-party work under its own license. See [Trademarks & usage responsibility](#trademarks--usage-responsibility) before using brand icons.

## Requirements

|           |              |
| --------- | ------------ |
| WordPress | 6.6 or newer |
| PHP       | 8.1 or newer |

A release zip already includes `vendor/` and `build/`. A git checkout does not.

## Install

### From a release zip

1. Upload `wp-lucide-icons.zip` in **Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin**, or extract it into `wp-content/plugins/wp-lucide-icons/`.
2. Activate **WP Icons**.

The zip must contain `vendor/autoload.php` and the `build/` bundles. Without the autoloader, the plugin shows an admin error and does not load.

### From git

Composer does not pull PHP packages. It only generates the PSR-4 autoloader (`WPIcons\` → `src/includes/`). `bootstrap.php` requires `vendor/autoload.php`.

```bash
composer install
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm sass:build
```

Then activate the plugin from that directory. See [Development](#development) for scripts and icon sync.

## Usage

### Block editor

Insert the **Icon** block from the Media category. Choose a library (or search all of them at once), pick an icon, then set size and color. Libraries with styles show a Weight or Style control, stroke-based styles show a stroke width, and Simple Icons can use each brand's own color.

To place an icon inside a paragraph, heading, or other text, use the **Insert icon** control on the block toolbar. Inline icons follow the surrounding text size and color.

### Classic editor (TinyMCE)

Use the **Insert icon** button on the TinyMCE toolbar. The same control appears in the Classic block and other TinyMCE fields.

### Elementor

The **Text Editor** widget, and any other Elementor control that uses the WordPress visual editor, has the same **Insert icon** button. Heading and other plain text fields stay plain text.

The **WP Icons** widget is in the WP Icons category. It displays one icon, with the same library, style, size, color, stroke, and accessible name as the block, plus alignment.

### Flatsome UX Builder

Add the **WP Icons** element from Content. **Choose icon** opens the shared picker. Alignment is left, center, or right.

### Shortcode

```
[wp_icon library="lucide" name="heart" size="24" color="currentColor" stroke="2"]
[wp_icon library="material-symbols" name="favorite" size="24" color="currentColor"]
```

| Attribute | Default                               | Notes                                                                |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `library` | Settings → default library (`lucide`) | Any library id from [Icon libraries](#icon-libraries)                |
| `name`    | empty                                 | Icon name in that library. Empty renders nothing                     |
| `size`    | Settings (24)                         |                                                                      |
| `color`   | Settings, per library                 | CSS color, or `brand` for the Simple Icons brand color               |
| `stroke`  | Settings, per library (2)             | Stroke-based styles only (Lucide, Tabler outline, Heroicons outline) |
| `weight`  | Settings, per library                 | Phosphor: `thin`, `light`, `regular`, `bold`, `fill`, `duotone`      |
| `style`   | Settings, per library                 | Tabler, Heroicons, and Ionicons styles, as shown on the Library page |
| `width`   | empty                                 | Legacy alias for `stroke` when `stroke` is omitted                   |
| `class`   | empty                                 | Extra class on the SVG                                               |
| `title`   | empty                                 | Accessible title. Empty means the icon is hidden from assistive tech |
| `align`   | empty                                 | `left`, `center`, or `right`. Empty leaves the SVG unwrapped         |

Omitted attributes fall back to **Appearance → WP Icons → Settings**.

`[lucide_icon name="heart" size="24" color="currentColor" width="2"]` still works. It is a Lucide-only alias; prefer `[wp_icon]`.

## Admin

WP Icons adds **Appearance → WP Icons** (Library and Settings tabs, capability `edit_theme_options`):

- **Library** — browse bundled icons, preview options, copy a shortcode
- **Settings** — defaults, which libraries are enabled, and per-library source

Each library source is either **plugin** (the catalog shipped in the plugin) or **cdn** (a newer catalog downloaded from the npm registry). CDN downloads are cached under `wp-content/uploads/wp-icons/` by a background WP-Cron job and are never fetched during page views. If the cache is empty, the full plugin uses the bundled catalog. The lite release has no bundled icon files, so every library uses the CDN source and nothing from that library renders until the cache exists. See [Release zip](#release-zip).

### External requests and privacy

- **Visitors:** icons are printed as inline SVG from the bundled or cached catalog. Front-end page views never contact npm, a CDN, or any other third party for icons.
- **Settings page:** opening **Appearance → WP Icons → Settings** asks `registry.npmjs.org` for the list of published versions of each library's package, to fill the **CDN version** list. The answer is cached for 12 hours. This happens even when every library uses the **plugin** source.
- **CDN source:** when a library is enabled and set to **cdn**, the server downloads that package's metadata and tarball from the npm registry shortly after you save, then once a day. Nothing is downloaded for libraries on the **plugin** source.
- These are server-to-server requests made with `wp_remote_get()`. The npm registry sees your server's IP address and the default WordPress user agent, which includes your site URL. No visitor data is sent.
- Uninstalling the plugin deletes its settings, the cached catalogs in `wp-content/uploads/wp-icons/`, its transients, and its cron event.

If you rely on a privacy policy, mention the npm registry when you use the CDN source or the Settings page.

## Development

You need PHP 8.1+, [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), Node.js, and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/).

```bash
composer install
pnpm install
pnpm sync-icons   # only when regenerating bundled icon maps
pnpm build
pnpm sass:build
```

While editing, `pnpm start` rebuilds the JavaScript bundles, and `pnpm sass` watches SCSS.

### Scripts

| Command           | What it does                                                                                                    |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm start`      | `@wordpress/scripts` in watch mode. Writes `build/` (Icon block, admin library, TinyMCE picker, `wpicons-api`). |
| `pnpm build`      | Production build of the same bundles.                                                                           |
| `pnpm sass`       | Watch `src/assets/scss` and write compressed CSS to `src/assets/css`.                                           |
| `pnpm sass:build` | One-shot SCSS compile.                                                                                          |
| `pnpm sync-icons` | Rewrite every bundled catalog from the versions pinned in `package.json`.                                       |
| `pnpm publish`    | Zip the full and lite releases with `node publish.mjs wp-lucide-icons`. This is not `npm publish`.              |

Versions come from the pinned devDependencies. To bundle a newer Lucide or Material Symbols release, change the pin (`pnpm add -D lucide-static@x`) and run the matching sync script.

Do not hand-edit the generated files under `src/includes/Icons/Catalogs/`.

### Composer

`composer.json` requires PHP `>=8.1` and autoloads `WPIcons\` from `src/includes/`. There are no Composer packages.

```bash
composer install
composer dump-autoload
```

Before packing a release zip, regenerate an optimized autoloader:

```bash
composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
```

`vendor/` is gitignored. A checkout without `composer install` will not run.

## Release zip

`publish.mjs` reads the `Version:` header in `wp-lucide-icons.php` and writes two archives. It does not bump the version, create a git tag, or upload the zip.

- `releases/wp-lucide-icons-{version}.zip` — full plugin, with the bundled icon catalogs
- `releases/wp-lucide-icons-lite-{version}.zip` — same plugin folder (`wp-lucide-icons/`), without the icon path files under `src/includes/Icons/Catalogs/`. Each library's `index.php` stays, so admin marks, viewBoxes, and brand metadata are still local. The lite copy of `wp-lucide-icons.php` is named **WP Icons Lite** and defines `WP_ICONS__LITE`. Every library then uses the CDN source: the server downloads the npm packages and caches them in `uploads/wp-icons/`.

Installing one zip replaces the other. WordPress does not delete files a new zip omits, so a lite install removes leftover variant catalog files from an earlier full install. Switching back to the full zip restores them.

The lite build needs outbound HTTPS to `registry.npmjs.org`, the PHP `Phar` extension, a writable uploads directory, and WP-Cron (or a server cron that hits `wp-cron.php`). Until the background fetch finishes, the picker has no icons. Front-end page views still only read the local cache.

1. Update the version in both places in `wp-lucide-icons.php`: the `Version:` header and the `WP_ICONS__VERSION` constant.
2. Update `package.json` and [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
3. Build what the zips must contain:

```bash
composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
pnpm build
pnpm sass:build
pnpm publish
```

Each zip includes:

- `wp-lucide-icons.php`, `bootstrap.php`, `uninstall.php`, `src/functions.php`
- `src/assets/css`, `src/assets/js`, `src/includes`, `src/languages`, `src/templates`
- `build/`
- `vendor/`

The lite zip omits every catalog PHP file except `index.php`. Both omit `node_modules`, `scripts/`, SCSS, Composer and npm config, this README, the changelog, and `publish.mjs`.

Run `pnpm sync-icons` before that sequence when the bundled catalogs should change. The full zip is the one that ships those catalogs.

## PHP

Theme and plugin code can render an icon in one line. The helpers exist as soon as WP Icons has loaded. `wpicons_loaded` fires at the end of its setup. Guard with `function_exists` when your plugin might run without WP Icons.

```php
if ( function_exists( 'wpicons_get_icon' ) ) {
    echo wpicons_get_icon( 'lucide:check', [ 'size' => 20, 'class' => 'my-plugin__icon' ] ); // phpcs:ignore WordPress.Security.EscapeOutput.OutputNotEscaped -- escaped by WP Icons.
}
```

`wpicons_icon()` prints that same markup. `wpicons_icon_exists()` reports whether the reference would render. `wpicons_get_libraries()` returns each library as an array (`id`, `label`, `enabled`, `variants`, `default_variant`, `supports`, `version`).

The reference is `library:name` or `library:name:variant`, for example `lucide:check`, `material-symbols:arrow_back`, or `phosphor:heart:bold`. A bare name such as `check` uses the default library from Settings. `$args['variant']` overrides the variant in the reference. `$args['library']` and `$args['name']` are ignored.

| Argument  | Default                  | Notes                                                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `size`    | Settings default size    | `wpicons_get_icon()` only. The lower-level renderer below defaults to 24               |
| `height`  | same as `size`           |                                                                                        |
| `color`   | Settings, per library    | CSS color, `var(--token)`, `currentColor`, or `brand` for the Simple Icons brand color |
| `stroke`  | Settings, per library    | Stroke-drawn styles only (Lucide, Tabler outline, Heroicons outline)                   |
| `variant` | variant in the reference | Phosphor weight, or a Tabler, Heroicons, or Ionicons style. Overrides the reference    |
| `class`   | empty                    | Extra class on the SVG                                                                 |
| `title`   | empty                    | Accessible name. Empty means decorative (`aria-hidden="true"`, `focusable="false"`)    |

The string is already escaped. Do not pass it through `wp_kses_post()`, which strips `<svg>`. A callback on `wpicons_icon_svg` has to return safe markup of its own.

An icon with a `title` is exposed as `role="img"` with that name (`aria-label` plus a `<title>`). On a button or link, leave the icon decorative and put the accessible name on the control.

### Hooks

| Hook                | Kind   | Arguments                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `wpicons_loaded`    | action | none. Fires when WP Icons has finished setting up                                                                                         |
| `wpicons_icon_args` | filter | `$attrs`, `$ref`. Runs for `wpicons_get_icon()` only, before the icon is rendered                                                         |
| `wpicons_icon_svg`  | filter | `$svg`, `$library`, `$name`, `$context`. `$context` is `variant`, `size`, `color`, `stroke`, `class`, `title`. Runs for every render path |

### Editor script

The block editor and the classic editor enqueue a script with the handle `wpicons-api`. It is also registered on admin screens, so another plugin can list `wpicons-api` as a script dependency and call `window.wpIcons` when it is there. The REST routes behind it require `edit_posts`. On the front end, render icons with the PHP helpers.

```js
const svg = await wpIcons.getIcon("tabler:star", { size: 20 });
const picked = await wpIcons.openPicker({ value: "lucide:check" });
```

`wpIcons.Icon` is a React component with props `icon`, `size`, `color`, `stroke`, `title`, and `className`. `icon` is the same `library:name[:variant]` reference. `wpIcons.parseRef()` splits a reference into `library`, `name`, and `variant`. `openPicker({ value, libraries })` resolves with `{ library, name, variant, size, color, stroke, title }`, or `null` when the dialog is closed. `libraries` is an optional list of library ids to show.

### Lower-level

```php
use WPIcons\Icons\Renderer;

echo (new Renderer())->fromAttributes([
    'library' => 'lucide', // lucide, material-symbols, simple-icons, phosphor, tabler, heroicons, ionicons, octicons
    'name'    => 'heart',
    'size'    => 24,       // omitted size is 24 here, not the Settings default
    'color'   => 'currentColor',
    'stroke'  => 2,        // stroke-drawn styles
    'variant' => '',       // Phosphor weight, or a Tabler / Heroicons / Ionicons style
    'class'   => '',
    'title'   => 'Favorite',
]);
```

An omitted `library` uses `lucide`. An empty `library` uses the Settings default. `weight` and `style` are still accepted as aliases of `variant`. An unknown name or a disabled library returns an empty string. This output also passes through `wpicons_icon_svg`.

## Trademarks & usage responsibility

WP Icons makes it quick to use existing open-source icon sets inside WordPress. It does not create or own those icons.

- **Third-party works.** Every icon set is the work of its authors and is licensed under its own terms, listed in [Icon libraries](#icon-libraries). WP Icons only provides access to the icons. It does not grant any rights beyond those licenses.
- **Brand icons.** Logos and brand marks (for example in Simple Icons, or the GitHub logos in Octicons) are trademarks of their owners. Owners often publish their own usage guidelines. Using a brand icon does not mean the brand owner endorses you, your site, or WP Icons.
- **Your responsibility.** You, as the site owner or user, decide which icons to use and where. You are responsible for making sure that use complies with each icon's license and with any trademark owner's guidelines.
- **No warranty.** WP Icons is free software, provided "as is" without warranty of any kind, as described in the GPL.
